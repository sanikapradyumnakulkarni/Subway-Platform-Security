Build a project that enhances subway platform safety using YOLO v7 to monitor passengers proximity to the train. The system detects a boundary line on the platform, marking individuals close to the train with a red bounding box to indicate danger. Passengers on the safer side of the boundary are marked with a green bounding box, indicating a safe distance. This project provides alerts to improve passenger awareness and prevent platform accidents.
